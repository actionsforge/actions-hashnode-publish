title: "Docs vs Blog: What's Better for Developer-Facing Content?"
tags: [docs, blogging, developer-experience, hashnode]

If you're building tools, writing tutorials, or maintaining an open-source project, you’ll eventually ask:

**Should I write this as documentation or a blog post?**

Here’s how I decide — and why both matter.

---

## 📘 Use Docs When...

- You want to explain **how something works**
- You need **structured navigation** (e.g., sidebar, TOC)
- It’s reference material: APIs, configs, setup
- It needs to stay updated over time

**Examples:**
- “Getting Started with MyTool”
- “Configuration Reference”
- “Deploying MyTool in Production”

---

## 📝 Use Blog Posts When...

- You want to share a **story or narrative**
- It’s a one-off: announcement, tutorial, postmortem
- You want **search traffic**, visibility, or SEO
- You’re explaining **why**, not just how

**Examples:**
- “How I Built MyTool’s CI Pipeline”
- “Lessons from Migrating to Terraform”
- “Announcing MyTool v2.0”

---

## 🎯 Hybrid: Blog-Powered Docs?

Some devs (like me) use **Hashnode or Dev.to** to:
- Write docs as **articles**
- Organize them with **tags** or **series**
- Cross-post tutorials to maximize reach

It works if:
- You’re solo
- Don’t want to manage Docusaurus or GitBook
- You just want Markdown + GitHub + API

## ✅ Summary

| Use Case          | Docs 📘 | Blog 📝 |
|------------------|---------|--------|
| Setup guide       | ✅      | ✅     |
| API reference     | ✅      | 🚫     |
| Personal story    | 🚫      | ✅     |
| SEO content       | 🚫      | ✅     |
| Always updated    | ✅      | 🚫     |
| One-off tutorial  | 🚫      | ✅     |

Use docs to **organize knowledge**, and blogs to **share experience**.
If you build tools, do both.
